#VRML_SIM R2020b utf8
#
# a passive Connector device which can connect to an active Connector device of same model.
# it has the shape of an box. it can only connect in the middle of one side.
# this side is in positive direction of z-axis.
# to connect, this passive device and the other active device must be close to each other
# and their z-axis must point to each other.
# this device needs an robot controller to turn it on by calling enable(timeStep).
